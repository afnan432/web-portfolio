        <h3>World Class Idiots</h3>
        <p>We ocassionally do lots of unnecessary things and always blast with fun. Sometime it’s shape grows or shrinks. Sometimes it’s members swap out. That is just life in it’s constant flow.
        There is a comfort in knowing that this inner circle is there for you – in all of your days. In your best ones. In your worst ones. This circle has your back. To support. To cheer you on. To offer a warm bed and a hot cup of tea at any time of the night. To answer your call or your text. To send out loving vibes when there is just a sense that they are needed. Words are often not needed. Just a look. Just a feeling. </p>
